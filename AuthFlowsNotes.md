# User Stories

Instead of Use Cases, Agile project owners do "user stories"
Who (user role) – Is this a customer, employee, admin, etc.?
What (goal) – What functionality must be achieved/developed? 
Why (reason) – Why does user want to accomplish this goal?

As a [user role], I want to [goal], so I can [reason].

* As a User I want to Register an email account into the system so I can access Authorized Content.
* As a Unregistered User/Registered User I want to Authenticate into the system with my Facebook account so I can access Authorized Content and avoid Registration.
* As an Admin I want to Automate the email verification so I can make sure I don´t have fake emails.
* As a Registered User I want to modify my User Profile so I can control my registered data in the system.
* As a Registered User I want to change my password so I can control my credentials.
* As a Registered User I want to reset my password via email link so I can recover my account access.
